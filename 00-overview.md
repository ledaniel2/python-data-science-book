# Learn Python for Data Science

## Introduction

Start learning Python for use in data science projects! This book will take you on an exciting journey into the world of data science using Python, one of today's most popular programming languages. No previous Python or programming experience is necessary, but if you have some already, great! There are many technical terms used but we go light on theory, preferring instead lots of example code demonstrations and breadth-first learning. We have tried to design this book to be accessible, engaging, and interesting for school and college students, as well as being relevant to a wider audience. So, buckle up and let's begin!
