In this chapter, we will focus on one of the most critical aspects of data science: working with data. The ability to effectively import, export, and manipulate data is a crucial skill for any aspiring data scientist. To help you master these skills, we will explore various methods for handling data in Python.

We will start by discussing different file formats commonly used for storing data, such as CSV, JSON, and Excel files. You will learn how to import and export data using these formats, ensuring you can seamlessly work with various data sources. Next, we will introduce `pandas`, a powerful Python library that simplifies data manipulation tasks and makes working with data a breeze.

With `pandas`, you will learn how to perform basic data manipulation tasks, such as filtering, sorting, and aggregating data. These techniques will enable you to quickly and efficiently process your data, preparing it for further analysis and exploration.

Our learning goals for this chapter are:

 * Learn how to import and export data using different file formats, such as CSV, JSON, and Excel
 * Understand the basics of `pandas` and how it simplifies data manipulation tasks
 * Master fundamental data manipulation techniques to efficiently process and prepare data for analysis

## 4.1: Data formats: CSV, JSON, and Excel

Data comes in various formats, and it is essential to understand how to read and write data using different file formats. Some of the most common file formats you will encounter while working with data are CSV, JSON, and Excel. We will discuss these formats and their origins and uses.

### Comma-Separated Values (CSV)

The origins of the CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format can be traced back to the early days of computing when data was typically stored and exchanged in plain text formats. CSV emerged as a simple, human-readable, and lightweight format for representing tabular data in plain text files. It has been in use since the 1970s, although the term "CSV" was first coined in the early 1980s.

CSV files store tabular data in a plain text format, with each row in the table represented by a line of text and the values in each row separated by commas. This simplicity has contributed to its widespread adoption in various domains, including data science, data analysis, and data storage.

Some common uses of CSV format files include:

 1. Data exchange: CSV files are widely supported by software applications, databases, and programming languages, making them a popular choice for exchanging data between different systems or platforms.

 2. Data storage: CSV files can store large amounts of data in a compact, plain text format that is easily accessible and readable by both humans and machines. This makes it a convenient choice for storing and sharing datasets, especially when working with smaller datasets or when more complex file formats are not required.

 3. Data analysis: The simplicity and wide support for CSV files make them a popular choice for data analysis tasks, as many data analysis tools and libraries can read and write CSV files with ease. In Python, for example, the pandas library provides robust support for working with CSV files.

 4. Data export: Many applications, such as spreadsheets, databases, and data visualization tools, provide the option to export data as a CSV file, making it easy to share data and analysis results with others.

 5. Data migration: CSV files can be used as an intermediary format for migrating data between different systems, as they are often easier to work with and transform than more complex file formats.

Closely related is the TSV (Tab-Separated Values) file format, where the values of each row are each separated by a tab instead of a comma. This can mean that the columns line up more accurately when the file is viewed in a text editor. Converting between the CSV and TSV formats is usually a simple task, and many spreadsheet applications support both formats.

In summary, the CSV format is popular due to its simplicity, readability, and wide support across various platforms and tools. It is commonly used for data exchange, storage, analysis, export, and migration tasks.

### JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)

JavaScript Object Notation was introduced by Douglas Crockford in the early 2000s. It was derived from the object literal notation in JavaScript, a programming language that was gaining widespread use for web development at the time. Crockford recognized the need for a lightweight, human-readable, and easily transmittable data interchange format that could be used by both humans and machines.

JSON was designed as an alternative to XML, which was the dominant data interchange format at the time. XML, while powerful and versatile, was perceived as complex, verbose, and harder to read and write, especially for web applications. JSON was designed to address these shortcomings, offering a simpler and more compact syntax.

Since its introduction, JSON has become a popular data interchange format and is now widely used for various purposes, including:

 1. Data exchange between client and server: JSON is widely used in web applications for exchanging data between the client (typically a web browser) and the server. The lightweight nature of JSON makes it suitable for transferring data over the Internet, reducing latency and improving the user experience.

 2. Configuration files: JSON is often used for storing configuration settings in applications, thanks to its human-readable nature and ability to represent complex data structures like nested objects and arrays.

 3. Data storage: Some NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB and Couchbase, use JSON-like formats to store data. These databases leverage the flexibility of JSON to store schema-less data, allowing for greater flexibility and scalability.

 4. APIs: JSON is the go-to format for many modern web APIs. RESTful APIs, in particular, often use JSON to represent resources and exchange data between the client and server. JSON's widespread adoption and ease of use have contributed to its popularity in this context.

 5. Serialization: JSON can be used as a serialization format for data structures in various programming languages, allowing for easy storage and transmission of data between different systems and languages.

In summary, JSON is widely used for various purposes, such as data exchange in web applications, configuration files, data storage, APIs, and serialization.

### Microsoft Excel

Microsoft Excel, a widely used spreadsheet application, has evolved over the years, resulting in multiple file formats. These file formats were developed to support different features and use cases. The most common Excel file formats include:

 1. XLS: XLS is the default file format for Excel versions 97-2003. It is a binary file format, meaning it contains a mix of data, text, and formatting elements in a single file. The XLS format uses the Binary Interchange File Format (BIFF) to store data, and it can store up to 65,536 rows and 256 columns. XLS files are used for creating, editing, and storing spreadsheet data, including formulas, charts, and formatting information. However, due to its limited features and compatibility issues, Microsoft introduced the XLSX format.

 2. XLSX: XLSX is the default file format for Excel versions 2007 and later. It is based on the Office Open XML (OOXML) standard, which makes it more accessible and compatible with other applications. XLSX files are essentially a collection of XML files compressed into a single ZIP archive. This format offers several advantages over the XLS format, including a larger worksheet capacity (up to 1,048,576 rows and 16,384 columns), better performance, and improved data recovery. XLSX files are used for a wide range of tasks, such as data analysis, financial modeling, reporting, and project management.

 3. XLSM: The XLSM file format is similar to XLSX but with added support for macros, which are small programs written in the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) language to automate tasks and add functionality to Excel. Macros can save time and reduce errors, but they also pose a security risk as they can contain malicious code. XLSM files are used when spreadsheets require advanced functionality or automation provided by macros.

 4. XLTX and XLTM: XLTX and XLTM are Excel template file formats for XLSX and XLSM files, respectively. These formats are used to create templates with predefined layouts, formatting, and settings. When you create a new workbook based on a template, Excel generates an XLSX or XLSM file with the same layout, formatting, and settings as the template.

 5. XLSB: The XLSB file format is a binary format similar to XLS but designed for Excel versions 2007 and later. XLSB files are more efficient in terms of storage and performance compared to XLSX and XLSM files, especially when working with large datasets. However, they are less compatible with third-party applications and may not be as easily accessible for data extraction or manipulation.

Excel files can contain cells with formulas and/or macros, which are often not compatible with third-party applications. It may be necessary to use the Excel file within the Excel application itself should the cells need to be recalculated, so exporting the required values to an intermediate CSV file may be a safer and better data science workflow.

In summary, the various Microsoft Excel file formats originated to support different application features, versions, and use cases. They cater to a wide range of needs, from data analysis and financial modeling to reporting, project management, and automation.

## 4.2: Importing and Exporting Data

One of the most important tasks in any data science project is importing and exporting data. We will cover how to import and export data using different file formats such as plain text files, CSV files, JSON files, and Microsoft Excel files. We will use the `pandas` library to make this process easier and more efficient. `pandas` is a powerful library that provides data structures and functions needed to work with structured data.

### Plain Text Files

To read from a plain text file, you can use Python's built-in `open()` function. The following code demonstrates how to read the contents of a plain text file into a Python string variable:

```python
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    data = file.read()
    print(data)
```

To write to a plain text file, you can use a similar approach:

```python
data = 'This is some sample text.'

with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write(data)
```

### CSV Files

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a popular file format for storing tabular data. A sample CSV file might look like:

```plaintext
Name,Age,City
Alice,25,New York
Bob,32,San Francisco
Charlie,28,Los Angeles
```

The `pandas` library makes it easy to read and write CSV files using the `read_csv()` and `to_csv()` functions, respectively.

Reading a CSV file:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
print(data.head())  # Output the first five rows
```

Writing a DataFrame to a CSV file:

```python
data.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)
```

If `index=True` is used instead, then the first column of the CSV file is set to the row number (starting from 0):

```plaintext
,Name,Age,City
0,Alice,25,New York
1,Bob,32,San Francisco
2,Charlie,28,Los Angeles
```

### JSON Files

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. You can read JSON files using the `read_json()` function and write data to a JSON file using the `to_json()` function in `pandas`.

Reading a JSON file:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_json('data.json')
print(data.head())
```

Writing a DataFrame to a JSON file:

```python
data.to_json('output.json', orient='records', lines=True)
```

Using `lines=True` as shown above, produces the output:

```json
{"Name":"Alice","Age":25,"City":"New York"}
{"Name":"Bob","Age":32,"City":"San Francisco"}
{"Name":"Charlie","Age":28,"City":"Los Angeles"}
```

Alternatively, using `lines=False` produces:

```json
[{"Name":"Alice","Age":25,"City":"New York"},{"Name":"Bob","Age":32,"City":"San Francisco"},{"Name":"Charlie","Age":28,"City":"Los Angeles"}]
```

### Microsoft Excel Files

The `pandas` library also supports reading and writing Microsoft Excel files using the `read_excel()` and `to_excel()` functions, respectively. To work with Excel files, you need to install the `openpyxl` library, with the terminal (or shell) command:

```bash
pip install openpyxl
```

Reading an Excel file:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_excel('data.xlsx', sheet_name='Sheet1')
print(data.head())
```

Writing a DataFrame to an Excel file:

```python
data.to_excel('output.xlsx', sheet_name='Sheet1', index=False)
```

In summary, we have covered how to import and export data using different file formats, including plain text files, CSV files, JSON files, and Microsoft Excel files. We used the `pandas` library to handle these tasks efficiently and conveniently.

## 4.3: Basic Data Manipulation with `pandas`

The `pandas` library has two main data structures: Series and DataFrame. A Series is a one-dimensional array-like object, while a DataFrame is a two-dimensional table with rows and columns. We will concentrate on DataFrames, and cover the following operations: creating DataFrames, indexing and slicing, filtering data, sorting data, and adding and dropping, columns and rows of data.

### Creating DataFrames

DataFrames are the primary data structure in `pandas` and are used to represent tabular data with rows and columns. You can create a DataFrame from a variety of sources, including Python dictionaries, lists, and NumPy arrays. Let's create a simple DataFrame from a Python dictionary:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {
    'name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eve'],
    'age': [25, 30, 35, 40, 45],
    'city': ['New York', 'San Francisco', 'Los Angeles', 'Seattle', 'Chicago']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

This will output:

```plaintext
      name  age           city
0    Alice   25       New York
1      Bob   30  San Francisco
2  Charlie   35    Los Angeles
3    David   40        Seattle
4      Eve   45        Chicago
```

### Indexing and Slicing

To access specific elements or subsets of a DataFrame, you can use the following techniques:

 * Selecting columns: `df['column_name']` or `df.column_name`
 * Selecting rows by index: `df.loc[index]` or `df.iloc[row_number]`
 * Slicing rows: `df[start:end]`

```python
# Selecting a single column
print(df['name'])

# Selecting multiple columns
print(df[['name', 'city']])

# Selecting a row by index
print(df.loc[2])

# Selecting a row by row number
print(df.iloc[2])

# Slicing rows using only rows 1-3 inclusive
print(df[1:4])
```

### Filtering data

You can filter rows in a DataFrame based on specific conditions. For example, you can select rows where a column's value meets certain criteria:

```python
# Filter rows where age is greater than 30
print(df[df['age'] > 30])
```

You can also combine multiple conditions using `&` (and) or `|` (or) operators (the Python keywords `and` and `or` are not used in this context):

```python
# Filter rows where age is greater than 30 and city is 'Los Angeles'
print(df[(df['age'] > 30) & (df['city'] == 'Los Angeles')])
```

### Sorting data

You can sort a DataFrame by one or more columns using the `sort_values()` method:

```python
# Sort by age, ascending
print(df.sort_values('age'))

# Sort by age, descending
print(df.sort_values('age', ascending=False))

# Sort by multiple columns
print(df.sort_values(['city', 'age']))
```

### Adding Columns

To add a new column, simply assign values to a new column name:

```python
# Add a new column
df['name_and_city'] = df['name'] + ' from ' + df['city']
print(df)
```

### Renaming Columns

To rename columns, use the `rename()` method and provide a dictionary with the current names as keys and the new names as values:

```python
# Rename columns
df = df.rename(columns={'old_name': 'new_name', 'old_name2': 'new_name2'})
```

### Dropping Columns

To remove a column, use the `drop()` method and specify the `axis=1` parameter:

```python
# Drop a single column
print(df.drop('age', axis=1))

# Drop multiple columns
print(df.drop(['age', 'name_and_city'], axis=1))
```

### Dropping Rows

To remove rows, use the `drop()` method and specify the `axis=0` parameter:

```python
# Drop a single row by index
print(df.drop(0, axis=0))

# Drop multiple rows by index
print(df.drop([0, 1, 2], axis=0))
```

To remove rows based on a condition, you can use a boolean mask:

```python
# Drop rows where a column meets a condition
print(df[df['city'] != 'New York'])
```

### Series

A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type, such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, or objects. It has an index that provides a label for each element in the array.

Here's an example of creating a simple `pandas` Series:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a pandas Series
series = pd.Series([10, 20, 30, 40, 50], index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'])

# Display the Series
print(series)
```

This will output:

```plaintext
a    10
b    20
c    30
d    40
e    50
dtype: int64
```

Now that you have learned basic data manipulation tasks with `pandas`, you can start exploring and analyzing your data. Practice these tasks on different datasets to gain more confidence in handling and manipulating data using `pandas`. In the next chapters, you'll learn more advanced techniques and methods to further process and analyze your data.
