# Learn Python for Data Science Book

This is a works in progress as the online companion repository to the book
**Learn Python for Data Science** (ASIN: B0C37SVQKZ) available from
[Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C37SVQKZ).

Currently, the majority of code samples should work without modification;
some from later chapters need valid web API user credentials in order to be
run. The full list of libraries needed to run all of the code samples is
located in chapter 3.
