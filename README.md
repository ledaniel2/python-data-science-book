# Learn Python for Data Science Book

This is the online companion repository to the book
**Learn Python for Data Science** (ASIN: B0C37SVQKZ) available from
[Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C37SVQKZ).

The majority of code samples in directory "samples"
should work without modification and are machine-extracted from the book;
some from later chapters need valid web API user credentials in order to be
run. The full list of libraries needed to run all of the code samples is
located in chapter 3.

Markdown sources for all of the chapters in the book are now available
to browse online. The command used to build the e-book under Windows 10 using
the "pandoc" program was:
