## 3.1: Overview of essential libraries

Data science encompasses various tasks, such as data manipulation, data cleaning, data visualization, machine learning, and more. Python offers an extensive ecosystem of libraries to simplify these tasks, making it an ideal language for data science. We will provide an overview of the essential libraries commonly used in data science projects.

### NumPy (Numerical Python)

NumPy is a foundational library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions to operate on them. Its primary data structure, the NumPy array, is more efficient than Python lists for numerical operations. This is partly because all elements must be of the same type, which is not a requirement for lists.

Key features of NumPy include:

 * Efficient array operations
 * Broadcasting for element-wise operations
 * Mathematical functions (linear algebra, Fourier analysis, etc.)
 * Random number generation

Here's an example of how to create a NumPy array from a Python list, and then perform an operation on all the elements in turn in a single operation:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a NumPy array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Perform element-wise addition
result = arr + 5
print(result)
```

This will output:

```plaintext
[ 6  7  8  9 10]
```

### `pandas` (Panel Data)

`pandas` is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis built on top of NumPy. It introduces two main data structures, DataFrame and Series, which are designed to handle and analyze data stored as tabular and one-dimensional data, respectively. `pandas` is great for working with structured data, like spreadsheets and tables.

Key features of `pandas` include:

 * Data handling: loading, saving, and cleaning
 * Data manipulation: reshaping, merging, and grouping
 * Handling missing values
 * Time series functionality

Here's an example of how to create a `pandas` DataFrame from a Python dictionary, with Python lists as the dictionary values. The DataFrame is then filtered by age and then output:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame
data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
        'Age': [25, 30, 35]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Filter DataFrame by age
filtered_df = df[df['Age'] > 25]
print(filtered_df)
```

This will output:

```plaintext
      Name  Age
1      Bob   30
2  Charlie   35
```

### `matplotlib`

`matplotlib` is a popular library for creating static, interactive, and animated data visualizations in Python. It provides a wide range of plots, such as line plots, scatter plots, and bar plots.

Key features of `matplotlib` include:

 * Customizable plots
 * 2D and 3D plotting
 * Integration with `pandas`
 * Ability to save plots in various formats

Here's an example of how to create a simple line plot from two Python lists, and then display it in a window on your Desktop (shown here is Python and `matplotlib` using `pyqt5` under Windows 10):

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a simple line plot
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 3, 7, 9, 10]

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
plt.title('Line Plot')
plt.show()
```

![Line Plot](./graphics/ch03fig1.png)

Should opening a new desktop window not be desired (or possible), the line `plt.show()` can be replaced with either `plt.savefig('filename.png')` (to save as a bitmap PNG graphic) or `plt.savefig('filename.svg')` (to save as a vector SVG).

### `seaborn`

`seaborn` is a data visualization library built on top of `matplotlib`. It offers a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. `seaborn` provides several built-in themes and color palettes to make it easy to create aesthetically pleasing visualizations.

Key features of `seaborn` include:

 * High-level interface for statistical graphics
 * Various built-in themes and color palettes
 * Advanced visualization types (e.g., violin plots, box plots, etc.)
 * Integration with `pandas` and `matplotlib`

Here's and example scatterplot with `seaborn` using one of the built-in datasets:

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the built-in 'penguins' dataset
penguins = sns.load_dataset('penguins')

# Create a scatter plot
sns.scatterplot(data=penguins, x='body_mass_g', y='bill_length_mm', hue='species')

# Add a title
plt.title('Penguins dataset scatter plot')

# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

Key features of `scikit-learn` include:

 * Supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms
 * Model selection and evaluation
 * Feature extraction and preprocessing
 * Integration with NumPy, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`

Example:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a Decision Tree classifier
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions and evaluate the model
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

This will output:

```plaintext
Accuracy: 1.00
```

### TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an open-source library for machine learning and artificial intelligence, developed by Google.

Here's a simple example of creating a neural network with TensorFlow and Keras, using the same iris dataset:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the dataset
iris = load_iris()

# Prepare the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris.data, iris.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
scaler = StandardScaler().fit(X_train)
X_train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Create a neural network
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(8, activation='relu', input_shape=(4,)))
model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=10)

# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test_scaled, y_test)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

This will output:

```plaintext
[many lines above...]
Accuracy: 0.97
```

By mastering their usage, you will have access to powerful tools for data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and machine learning. As you progress through the book, we will delve deeper into each of these libraries, learning how to use them effectively for various data science tasks.

The rest of this chapter covers the installation process for each of these libraries, and provides further insight into their backgrounds and applications. Keep in mind that installing some of these libraries may require significant download bandwidth (potentially hundreds of megabytes), but you only need to complete the installation process once for each environment you set up (see chapter 2 for details of this).

## 3.2: NumPy

NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is an open-source library that was created by Travis Oliphant in 2006. It emerged as a result of the need for a more efficient and convenient array processing package in Python. Before NumPy, Python had limited support for numerical computing, and it relied on Numeric and Numarray, two separate numerical libraries that had overlapping functionalities but were not fully compatible with each other.

Travis Oliphant, a scientist with a background in numerical computing, decided to create a new library that combined the best features of Numeric and Numarray while addressing their limitations. He designed NumPy to be fast, easy to use, and flexible, enabling it to become the foundation for many other scientific computing libraries in Python.

Uses of NumPy include:

 1. Efficient array operations: NumPy provides the ndarray (N-dimensional array) data structure, which is a more efficient and convenient alternative to Python lists for numerical operations. This enables faster computations and reduces the memory footprint.

 2. Broadcasting: NumPy allows for broadcasting, which is a mechanism to perform element-wise operations on arrays of different shapes and sizes, without the need for explicit loops or reshaping.

 3. Mathematical functions: NumPy offers a rich set of mathematical functions, including basic arithmetic operations, linear algebra, statistical functions, and more. These functions are designed to work seamlessly with NumPy arrays and are optimized for performance.

 4. Random number generation: NumPy provides functions for generating random numbers from various probability distributions, which is useful in simulations, statistical analyses, and machine learning.

 5. Interoperability: NumPy serves as a foundation for many other scientific libraries in Python, such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn`. These libraries build upon NumPy's functionality and data structures, making it easier to work with data across different domains.

NumPy can be installed using `pip` with the following command, in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

### Creating NumPy arrays

NumPy arrays are the primary data structure in the library and are more efficient than Python lists when it comes to numerical operations. You can create NumPy arrays from lists, tuples, or by using built-in functions.

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating NumPy arrays from lists
list_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print("Array from a list:", list_array)

# Creating NumPy arrays from tuples
tuple_array = np.array((6, 7, 8, 9, 10))
print("Array from a tuple:", tuple_array)

# Creating NumPy arrays using built-in functions
zeros_array = np.zeros(5)
print("Array of zeros:", zeros_array)

ones_array = np.ones(5)
print("Array of ones:", ones_array)

range_array = np.arange(1, 11, 2)
print("Array with a range of values:", range_array)
```

### Array operations

NumPy supports element-wise and matrix operations on arrays. These operations are fast and efficient, thanks to the underlying C and Fortran implementations.

```python
A = np.array([1, 2, 3])
B = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Element-wise addition
C = A + B
print("Element-wise addition:", C)

# Element-wise subtraction
D = A - B
print("Element-wise subtraction:", D)

# Element-wise multiplication
E = A * B
print("Element-wise multiplication:", E)

# Element-wise division
F = A / B
print("Element-wise division:", F)

# Matrix multiplication
G = np.dot(A, B)
print("Matrix multiplication:", G)
```

### Array indexing and slicing

Indexing and slicing NumPy arrays is similar to Python lists. However, multi-dimensional arrays allow for more complex indexing and slicing operations.

```python
# Create a 1D array
array_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Indexing a 1D array
print("First element:", array_1d[0])
print("Last element:", array_1d[-1])

# Slicing a 1D array
print("First three elements:", array_1d[:3])
print("Last two elements:", array_1d[-2:])

# Create a 2D array
array_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Indexing a 2D array
print("Element at position (1,2):", array_2d[1, 2])

# Slicing a 2D array
print("First two rows:\n", array_2d[:2, :])
print("Last column:\n", array_2d[:, -1])
```

### Array reshaping and manipulation

Reshaping arrays is a common operation in NumPy, and it can be performed using the reshape function. Other array manipulation functions include concatenate, vstack, and hstack.

```python
# Create a 1D array
array_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

# Reshape the 1D array into a 3x3 2D array
array_2d = array_1d.reshape(3, 3)
print("Reshaped 2D array:\n", array_2d)

# Flatten the 2D array back into a 1D array
array_flattened = array_2d.flatten()
print("Flattened 1D array:", array_flattened)

# Concatenate two arrays
A = np.array([1, 2, 3])
B = np.array([4, 5, 6])
C = np.concatenate((A, B))
print("Concatenated array:", C)

# Stack arrays vertically
D = np.vstack((A, B))
print("Vertical stack:\n", D)

# Stack arrays horizontally
E = np.hstack((A, B))
print("Horizontal stack:", E)
```

### Array broadcasting

Broadcasting is a powerful NumPy feature that allows you to perform arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes without the need for explicit looping or reshaping.

```python
A = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
B = np.array([1, 2, 3])

# Add B to each row of A
C = A + B
print("Broadcasted addition:\n", C)

# Multiply each row of A by B
D = A * B
print("Broadcasted multiplication:\n", D)
```

### Statistical functions

NumPy provides various statistical functions to perform calculations on arrays, such as mean, median, standard deviation, and correlation coefficient.

```python
import numpy as np

data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

# Calculate the mean
mean = np.mean(data)
print("Mean:", mean)

# Calculate the median
median = np.median(data)
print("Median:", median)

# Calculate the standard deviation
std_dev = np.std(data)
print("Standard deviation:", std_dev)

# Calculate the correlation coefficient
data_1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
data_2 = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8, 10])
corr_coef = np.corrcoef(data_1, data_2)
print("Correlation coefficient:\n", corr_coef)
```

In summary, we have covered the fundamentals of NumPy, including creating and manipulating arrays, performing arithmetic operations, broadcasting, indexing and slicing, and using statistical functions. As you continue your data science journey, you'll find that a strong understanding of NumPy will be invaluable for working with more complex tasks and tools.

 * `retry`: This library attempts to work around rate limits of some public APIs

The commands below can be used to install these extra libraries as needed:

```bash
pip install pyqt5     # Under Linux, it may be necessary to install additional package(s)
pip install openpyxl
pip install pingouin
pip install plotly
pip install bokeh
pip install geopandas
pip install folium
pip install scikit-optimize
pip install statsmodels
pip install nltk
pip install spacy
pip install gensim
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install scrapy
pip install retry
```

Finally, here is how to install all of the libraries we met earlier in this chapter as a single `pip` invocation:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
```
